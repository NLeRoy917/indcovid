Indcovd.com is a site that goes beyond the typical Coronavirus dashboard. Here, we explore how the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected and marginilzed under-privileged groups in Indiana. Using demographic data collected from the Indiana State Department of Health and the most up-to-date data on SARS-CoV-2, we can draw correlations between health-care outcomes and people of color.
